 ** Simplified TARGA library for Intro to Graphics Classes
 **
 ** This is a simple library for reading and writing image files in
 ** the TARGA file format (which is a simple format). 
 ** The routines are intentionally designed to be simple for use in
 ** into to graphics assignments - a more full-featured targa library
 ** also exists for other uses.
 **
 ** This library was originally written by Alex Mohr who has assigned
 ** copyright to Michael Gleicher. The code is made available under an
