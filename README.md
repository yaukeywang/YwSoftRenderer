# YwSoftRenderer
Implementing a Soft Renderer for Learning CG.

### About
Mostly coming from [Muli3D](http://muli3d.sourceforge.net/), improved by my understanding. It is still a long and hard trip, but worthwhile.

### Note
Code in `DeprecatedCode` folder is legncy deprecated, only used for reference and will be removed later.

### Progress
- [x] Math support.
- [x] Base rasterization and rendering stuffs as [Muli3D](http://muli3d.sourceforge.net/) supported.
- [x] [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/) support.
- [x] `Input` module.
- [x] `Stencil Buffer` support.
- [x] `State Block` optimize with pooling.
- [x] `Model Data Loading` module.
- [ ] `Resource and IO` module. **[Working on...]**
- [ ] `Texture Data Loading` module.
- [ ] `Log` module.
- [ ] `PBR` demo.
- [ ] `Low Level Memory Pool` support.
- [ ] `Linux` support
- [ ] `Mac OS X` support.
- [ ] Maybe a `Shader Compiler and Runtime` support.
- [ ] Something unknown...
